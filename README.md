As we head into the next decade, here's a throwback to remind ourselves how far we've come. An iPod Classic build using React Hooks (no Redux this time), TypeScript, and GraphQL.

I built this thing to be very extensible â€“ to the point where it can even run games (like brick!). In the future I might consider adding a few more little apps and easter eggs (theming?).

## Details

Here's a breakdown of the Full Stack:
#### Frontend: 
- JS: TypeScript, React (Hooks, Context)
- Styles: Styled Components, Framer Motion (for some of the animations)
- Textures/Icons: All SVGs created by me in Figma
- API: GraphQL

#### Backend
- API: Laravel (PHP) with GraphQL middleware
- DB: MySQL

## Running Locally

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
